# RGL Curvilinear Perspective Grid Generator
## A perspective grid generator for 2D animation, built with Processing & ControlP5

This is a tool to assist in drawing panning perspective backgrounds for 2D animation.
was originally built as an in-house tool by Studio RGL in London. We don't require you to credit us, but if you use this in your work feel free to link to our Twitter etc. And of course, tweet us some pictures of your art, we'd love to see what you're making!

Usage:
 1) Run the program (tested using Processing 3.5, you can compile and run standalone if u want)
 3) Move the sliders to get the grid you want (use scroll wheel for fine incremental control)
 4) Click to save a PDF or PNG
 2) Pick a file location
 4) Optional - if you want to customize the grids (for example for import into Adobe Animate or OpenToonz) you can open them in a vector art tool like Adobe Illustrator - you can use "select by colour" to separate the different grids onto layers, etc.
 5) Make some cool animation!
 6) Use 'ESC' to quit
