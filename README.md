# Curvilinear Grid Generator
## A grid generator for 2D animation, built with Processing & ControlP5

This was originally built as an in-house tool by Studio RGL in London. We don't require you to credit us, but if you use this in your work feel free to point people to our Twitter, we'd love to see what you get up to!
